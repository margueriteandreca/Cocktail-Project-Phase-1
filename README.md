click the remove button on existing ingredients, and as as many ingredients as they wish from the dropdown menu. 
Once they are satisied with the drink's current ingredients, they may click the "Mix it in!" button to save their changes,
so that when they wish to revist the drink, they will be able to view it with their preferred ingredients.
