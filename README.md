Find My Cocktail is an interactive website that allows the user to find the perfect drink according to their tastes. 
Upon loading the page, the user is met with a list of Amerian classic cocktails, whose details can be displayed by 
clicking on its corresponding image. The details inclue the cocktail's name, image, and ingredients. Below these 
details, there is a form containing a dropdown menu, which allows the user to make changes to each drink. They may
click the remove button on existing ingredients, and as as many ingredients as they wish from the dropdown menu. 
Once they are satisied with the drink's current ingredients, they may click the "Mix it in!" button to save their changes,
so that when they wish to revist the drink, they will be able to view it with their preferred ingredients. 


However, if the user is new to mixed drinks and wonders what they might like, they can search for drinks that match ingredients
they like, On the bottom-right of the window, the user can click the "Find your favorite!" button to display a pop-up which will
allow them to select their prefered ingredients by clicking on their corresponding images. When they are ready, they click the 
"Let's Mix" button, where they will receive various cocktail suggestions. These suggestions are fetched from the Cocktail Database API,
and provide a much wider range of options than the classics listed on the sidebar.
